1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

**Client-side routing is when navigation between pages (views) is handled on the front-end by the browser.  In client-side routing the data that is needed for the app is downloaded initially and routed is accomplished without page reload.  In server-side routing in order to present data, you have to make a call and the server is responsible for serving up the page with data.**
